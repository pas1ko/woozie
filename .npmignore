# Use a .npmignore file to keep stuff out of your package
# Read about how to use .npmignore: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package

# Ignore everything
*

# But not these files...
!dist
!dist/**

# Ignore all files named .DS_Store or ending with .log
**/.DS_Store
**.log

# The following paths and files are never ignored,
# so adding them to .npmignore is pointless:

# package.json
# README (and its variants)
# CHANGELOG (and its variants)
# LICENSE / LICENCE
